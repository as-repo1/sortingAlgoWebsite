                    <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
                    <p>Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares
                        adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.</p>

                    <p>Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the
                        unsorted list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them.</p>

                        sorted and then traverses the tree (in-order) to get the sorted sequence.</p>

                    <p>Shell Sort is an in-place comparison sort that can be seen as an extension of insertion sort.
                        It reduces the number of comparisons by sorting the elements at different intervals.</p>
